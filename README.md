Update notes:
After the update, load the enclosed d-tool_secfix.mrc, this can be located anywhere that mIRC can access.
Younly have to specify the path:
/load -rs [PATH]\d-tool_secfix.mrc
Then enter the command /secfixnce, then the script runs throughnce, reports what it has done 
in the d-tool window, moves itself to the trash and unloads itself. So you don't have to do anything 
else after that.
